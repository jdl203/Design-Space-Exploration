# Design-Space-Exploration
Design Space Exploration using SimpleScalar to explore an 18-dimensional processor pipeline and memory hierarchy design space. Two different optimization
functions were used to determine the best performing design including:  
  The “best” performing overall design (in term of the geometric mean of normal-ized execution time normalized across all benchmarks)
  The most energy-efficient design (as measured by the lowest geometric mean ofnormalized energy-delay product [units of energy delay 
    product are joule-seconds]across all benchmarks)
